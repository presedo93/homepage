                                different fields for the last 6 years. Before getting down to
                                business, here it is a little bit about me:

                                        {'~~>'} üå± I really love to learn about new topics and new
                                        technologies. I'm not afraid of dealing with new challenges.

                                        developer, also as a machine learning engineer, I've been
                                        involved in devops projects and lately I have started to
                                        focus in full stack development!

                                        different projects but time is limited... lately I've been
                                        thinking on the idea of working on a reinforcement learning
                                        project with some focus on financial markets and create some
                                        mobile app to use it.

                                        all kind of video games hehe. But on my college years, Dark
                                        Souls saga was the main time consuming task in my life,{' '}

                                above but we can make use of this section to talk a little bit
                                deeper :). I studied <b>Telecom engineer</b> but while I was
                                doing the degree I realized that what I was addicted to was to
                                coding. As in the degree all the coding subjects we had were
                                involved with electronics, I decided to study a master related
                                to that.

                                Once I finished my master's thesis, I felt that I needed some
                                real world working experience and found an opportunity as an
                                embedded software developer. Six years have passed since that
                                day, and two things that I can promise are that I learnt a lot
                                and that I enjoyed it a lot!
