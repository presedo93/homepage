                        I&apos;m Rene Presedo and this is my personal webpage, make yourself
                        at home üòÅ! I&apos;m a software developer who has been working in
                        different fields for the last 6 years. Before getting down to
                        business, here it is a little bit about me:

                        {'~~>'} üå± I really love to learn about new topics and new
                        technologies. I&apos;m not afraid of dealing with new challenges!

                        {'~~>'} üëØ Along my carrer, I&apos;ve worked as an embedded
                        developer, also as a machine learning engineer, I&apos;ve been
                        involved in devops projects and lately I have been part of full
                        stack development teams!

                        {'~~>'} ü•Ö Some goals: I would love to work in a lot of different
                        projects but time is limited... lately I&apos;ve been thinking on
                        the idea of working on a reinforcement learning project with some
                        focus on financial markets or learn about mobile development.

                        games (well, to be honest, I love nearly all kind of video games
                        hehe)!. But on my college years, Dark Souls saga was the main time
                        consuming task in my life,{' '}

                        Well... to be honest, most of my relevant info is in the lines above
                        but we can make use of this section to talk a little bit deeper :).
                        I studied <b>Telecom engineer</b> but while I was doing the degree,
                        I realized that what I was keen to was to coding. As in the degree
                        all the coding subjects we had were involved with electronics, I
                        decided to study a master related to that.

                    <Text>
                        Once I finished my master&apos;s thesis, I felt that I needed some
                        real world working experience and found an opportunity as an
                        embedded software developer. Six years have passed since that day,
                        and two things that I can promise are that I learnt a lot and that I
                        enjoyed it a lot!
